#Sublime Text Plugins in Haxe

Since haxe now supports python, it is possible to develop sublime text plugins with haxe.

Currently only the basic hello world plugin works - but there's not much left to do to finish the externs.

Hopefully one day we'll be able to rewrite the haxe plugin in haxe!

###TODO
- varargs for all cases where 'args' param is used
- Sublime class, (with enums)
- Window class
- complete View class
- complete EventListener class
- add [missing features](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/api.html#sublime_plugin.EventListener.on_query_completions)
